        The internal demonstrator "Sketch Drawing" allowed individual objects to be recognized using drawings drawn with the mouse. The aim of this project was to record the drawings by hand instead.<br><br>
        To achieve this target, I developed an AI developed that takes individual pictures of the hand with the help of the camera and assesses the hand's pose. The drawings are then recorded depending on the pose and passed on to the AI, which then classifies the drawings.
