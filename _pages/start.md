Hello everyone and welcome to my page! My name is Alymbek and I am a Data Scientist and AI Engineer.

I studied a master degree in [Autonomous Systems](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/studieren/abschluesse/master/autonome-systeme-msc.en.jsp) at the TU Darmstadt.

During my studies, I worked on my [master's thesis]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/alymbek_thesis.pdf) with the title "Learning Vision-Based Tactile Skills for Robotic Architectural Assembly". There, I cooperated with two 7 degrees-of-freedom leightweight robotic arms KUKA iiwa.

I also know [how to teach the robot to play beerpong]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/paper.pdf) with a win percentage of ca. 80%.

I am a Technology Consultant at [Lufthansa Industry Solutions](https://www.lufthansa-industry-solutions.com/) where I help the customers in building models to extract valuable insights from their business processes.

I was previously a software developer at [Varian Medical Systems](https://www.varian.com/) developing a distributed machine learning portal for medical researchers. We spoke C#, Typescript and T-SQL.

I love my lovely wife, tennis, guitars, piano, chess, jogging, football, winter sports, singing and F.C.Barcelona.
