        Hello everyone and welcome to my page! My name is Alymbek and I am a Data/AI Scientist.

      <p>
        Previously, I studied a master degree in <a href="https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/studieren/abschluesse/master/autonome-systeme-msc.en.jsp" target="_blank">Autonomous Systems</a> at the TU Darmstadt.
        During my studies, I worked on my <a href="https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/uploads/Team/BorisBelousov/alymbek_thesis.pdf" target="_blank">master's thesis</a> with the
        title "Learning Vision-Based Tactile Skills for Robotic Architectural Assembly". There I cooperated with two 7 degrees-of-freedom leightweight robotic arms KUKA iiwa.
        I also know <a href="/assets/paper.pdf" target="_blank">how to teach the robot to play beerpong</a> with a win percentage of ca. 80%.
