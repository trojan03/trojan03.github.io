Hello everyone and welcome to my page! My name is Alymbek and I am a Data Scientist, AI and Robotics Engineer.

I studied a master degree in [Autonomous Systems](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/studieren/abschluesse/master/autonome-systeme-msc.en.jsp) at the TU Darmstadt.

During my studies, I worked on my [master's thesis]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/alymbek_thesis.pdf) with the title "Learning Vision-Based Tactile Skills for Robotic Architectural Assembly". There, I cooperated with two 7 degrees-of-freedom leightweight robotic arms KUKA iiwa.

I also know [how to teach the robot to play beerpong]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/paper.pdf) with a win percentage of ca. 80%.

I am currently with [R+V Versicherung](https://www.ruv.de/home/) - one of the Germany's largest group of insurance companies. I am focused on fraud detection and natural language processing.

I was previously with [Nexplore Technology](https://nexplore.com/) - a technology startup within the Hochtief Group. I was developing the famous [Spot by Boston Dynamics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlkCQXHEgjA) and shaping with it the future of the construction industry. I was also involved in many research activities which included solving machine learning, computer vision and data processing tasks.

I was a Technology Consultant with [Lufthansa Industry Solutions](https://www.lufthansa-industry-solutions.com/) where I was helping customers with building AI models to extract valuable insights from their business processes.

I was also a software developer with [Varian Medical Systems](https://www.varian.com/) developing a distributed machine learning portal for medical researchers. We spoke C#, Typescript and T-SQL.

I love my lovely wife, tennis, guitars, piano, chess, jogging, football, winter sports, singing and F.C.Barcelona.
